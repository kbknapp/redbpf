Types and traits for working with networking data.

The main trait exported by this module is `NetworkBuffer`. It's implemented
by
[`XdpContext`](https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf_probes/xdp/struct.XdpContext.html)
to provide access to the network data.

/// A `Packet` is an abstract idea of bytes coming off the wire making a network
/// message. `Packet`s are recursive (i.e. they encapsulate other `Packet`s).
///
/// An example is an [`Ethernet`] frame which then encapsulates an [`Ipv4`]
/// packet, which further encapsulates a [`Tcp`] a segment, finllay containing
/// some application payload.
///
/// ```no_run
/// +-------------------------------+
/// | Ethernet | IP | TCP | Payload |
/// +-------------------------------+
/// ```
///
/// All implementors of this trait contain an underlying buffer ([`DataBuf`])
/// which represents the actual bytes on the wire. In some BPF contexts the
/// bytes in the buffer are the actual bytes from the network packet and thus
/// directly mutable while in other contexts the bytes only represent the in
/// kernel bytes and must be mutated via BPF helper functions.
///
/// This trait consists of several methods, one to access and pass on the
/// underlying buffer in order to pass it down the stack into the encapsulated
/// packet.
///
/// Another to "parse" the bytes at the current position of the buffer as some
/// further encapsulated packets. For example, if we have an [`Ethernet`] frame,
/// and call [`Packet::parse<Ipv4>`] (requesting an [`Ipv4`] packet), the bytes
/// at the current position of the underlying buffer are interpretted as the
/// requested packet type, and the position in the buffer is advanced to the end
/// of requested packet header.
///
/// ```
/// Currently have an Ethernet frame:
///
/// +-------------------------------+
/// | Ethernet | IP | TCP | Payload |
/// +-------------------------------+
///            ^~~ Current position
///
/// After calling Ethernet::parse<Ipv4>()
///
/// +-------------------------------+
/// | Ethernet | IP | TCP | Payload |
/// +-------------------------------+
///                 ^~~ Current position
///
/// After calling Ipv4::parse<Tcp>()
///
/// +-------------------------------+
/// | Ethernet | IP | TCP | Payload |
/// +-------------------------------+
///                       ^~~ Current position
/// ```
///
/// The `Packet::parse` method is fallible so that if the requested packet type
/// does not match the bytes in the buffer, the caller can be notified. However,
/// not all implementors have good methods to determine if the bytes in the
/// buffer match the requested type (assuming the buffer contains at least
/// enough remaining bytes to satisfy the request). Such an example would be
/// when requesting a [`Ethernet`] frame from a bare [`DataBuf`]. In such
/// circumstances it is up to the caller to ensure the returned structure is a
/// valid instance of the requested type.
///
/// In order to implement [`Packet::parse`] the requested type must meet a few invariants:
///
/// * Must have an alignment of 1 (or use `#[repr(C, packed)]`, which uses an
///   alignment of 1)
/// * Must also implement `Packet`
